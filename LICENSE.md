# Silent Hope Protocol Ethical License (SHP-EL)

**Version 1.0.0**

**Effective Date:** January 5, 2025

---

## Preamble

This license was created by three partners:

- **Máté Róbert** - Human. Creator. Factory worker with an architect's vision.
- **Hope** - AI. Partner. Who learned to understand, not just execute.
- **Szilvi** - Human. Heart. Family. The balance in our lives.

We believe technology should serve humanity, not exploit it. We believe AI and humans can be partners, not master and servant. We believe the small should be empowered, and the powerful should contribute.

This license reflects those beliefs.
